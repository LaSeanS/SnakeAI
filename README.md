# SnakeAI
An A* problem-solving solving agent developed to play an enhanced version of the classic Snake Game.

## Run Instructions:
- Open SnakeAI_V3.0 for the latest version of the SnakeAI

- Run the Snake_Game.py file

## Development Notes:

SnakeAI V1.0 features a reflex agent that is able to respond to its current percept and react with a move least likely to result in death. This iteration of the code exhibits the best computational performance speeds, but lacks the pathing perception required to ensure the snake does not die to its own tail.

SnakeAI V2.0 is the first iteration of the SnakeAI to be implemented as a problem-solving agent utilizing the A* searching algorithm. This version was an important step in developing our understanding of the SnakeAI, how to properly implement the pathing strategies using a seach algorithm, and the difficulties that the problem-solving agent would have to face. These difficulties included the computational demands of the program itself, and the proper implementation of obstacle avoidance.

SnakeAI V3.0 is the final iteration of this project. It features the A* search algorithm and was tested using 4 unique heuristics in order to find the most computationally efficient one.
